> This explained how to solve the problem using backtracking, and provided some example code, as well as functions that should be included to help the recursive function that solves the problem.

Issues:
  The heuristic solution runs for a board of any size, but the backtracking solution takes a very, very, *very* long time for any start position that is not next to any edges. Instead of taking a command line argument for the size of board/start position, the program prompts the user for these values.

  To run the program, simply compile in C++ then run ./a.out, the program will prompt user for values and then terminate when it is finished.
